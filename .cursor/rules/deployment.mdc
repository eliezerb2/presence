- never deploy anything to the host

- use a dedicated kubernetes namespace and never use the default namespace
- use helm to deploy the application and create all necessary kubernetes resources
- always uninstall the helm chart and verify that all application resources are deleted before redeploying the helm chart
- when waiting for a deployment, make sure it is running and not crashing
